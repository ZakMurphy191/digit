        <p style="text-align:center"> After analyzing the texts of Charlotte Bronte and Emily Bronte
            I have came to the conclusion that out of the two the most similar text was Charlotte
            Bronte's text of "Jane Eyre". Now in the comparison between the two I said that it was
            completely different writing styles which I believe to be true but comparing Charlotte
            and her sister Emily's text Emily had written her text strictly in first person, and as
            we talked about and looked over Charlotte writes her's in both first and third person
            point of view, so the text between Charlotte and Jane Austen's text is more relevant to
            each other. In the question "Can you see some ways they differ in their words and
            phrases?" Yes I can see many ways that they are different from each other from Janes,
            emily's, and Charlotte's, i found them to be recognizably different within their
            phrases, as they used many of the same words, but the phrases they used the context of
            their words stood out like a sore thumb. This was very easily depictable after digging
            deeper into the texts. In Conclusion, I believe that all writing styles used in the
            texts are unique in their own way but they do differentiate from each other, I also
            beleive that Charlotte's did tell the truth and her text was way "different" from Jane
            Austen's.</p>
