            <p>I also like to help out my community and participate in cleaning roads, getting food to the poor, and all of the above to make sure everyone else is safe. If I were to describe myself with a quote I believe my personality is best represented by the saying "Be strong but not rude, be kind but not weak, be humble but not timid, be proud but not arrogant."</p>

        <p>Out of all of my hobbies i find the most interest in dirt biking, as i am a Monster Energy Kawasaki professional rider. I am honored to be where i am in the racing world, but i do think that all my hard work and time paid off in it. I get to travel the world and race dirt bikes while being paid. So i would like to give you some advice, if you really want to do something, do it and do not look back!
