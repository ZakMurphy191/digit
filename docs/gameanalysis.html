        <p> For the Game Analysis assignment I had the option of chosing between many indie games to
            provide feedback of my thoughts on the game I chose. This was one of my favorite
            projects that I have completed so far in the Digital Arts and Media major. This Project
            consisted of analyzing the developers concepts and ideas that the developer's have
            created over the course of the game and its making. So what game did I choose?</p>

        <p> Tadpole Tales is an indie game that is solely based on to clean up the river from the
            monsters. I believe that the Monsters represent waste in today's society that is thrown
            into rivers, and the Tadpoles are the creatures that live amongst that biological
            environment that wanna live in a clean envirorment.Within the game the Tadpoles have the
            mission to clean up the river, by shooting them with their mouths using a disinfectant
            that "cleans them up" which gets them closer to living in a clean environment. The Game
            Developers really put a lot of time into this game as it has a real life meaning, and I
            believe that they are trying to spread awareness about our ecosystems. What I mean by
            this is, they want people to understand that our garbage and polution we put into their
            "homes" is damaging to them and the other creatures that live there, while also we
            should be keeping every aspect of the world as clean as possible. </p>

        <p> The graphics of the game are not very complex, but they are unique in their own way
            everything within the game was hand drawn which adds flavor to the game. The game gives
            you the details of the storyline while loading in which added anticipation to help
            defend the river from the monsters that have corrupt the rivers envirorment, while the
            tadpoles want the river to be clean and friendly, so we must help defend and “clean” up
            the river. On the left you will see a picture of a boss fight, I used this picture as it
            shows how unique the hand drawn art really is. The picture on the right shows a preview
            of the game premier before you play, I thought they went above and beyond with the short
            film showing the backstory to Tadpole Tales. </p>

        <p> The settings in tadpole tails are very easy to control you have three settings start
            extras, and options, options allow you to change the graphics within the game.This is
            mostly to tailor the best possible graphics to the technology you are playing Tadpole
            Tales on. Although they are very simple to control, I believe that they have just the
            right amount so people do not have issues with understanding the options and graphics
            available within the game. Some game developers make this very hard to understand and it
            actually turns them away from playing, furthermore, the user might not even try the game
            if the options are to complex, but in Tadpole Tales they hit this right on the money it
            is simple, yet a great system. The start button is just in the menu which allows you to
            play the game and extras shows players the back story to the game and has links to all
            the creators that developed the game over the years. In all I would say that the game is
            very easy to maneuver within and is a very pleasant experience.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p> Within Tadpole Tales you cannot pick different characters to clean up the river with,
            you have to work your way up by collecting hearts as they give you more health which
            results in recieving better characters to defeat the monsters and clean the river with.
            The character that you start with is a Tadpole that eventually becomes bigger as you
            gain hearts, the second charcter you can earn is the evolved Tadpole that is slowly
            becoming bigger and more powerful towards the monsters, and the last charcter you can
            achieve is the Frog, the Frog is the most powerful character in Tadpole Tales, letting
            you clean the river with ease. I feel that character customization is something the game
            developer can improve upon as people like to make their character into their own. This
            would give the game a more diverse feeling and have users more connected to the game. </p>
        <p> Within Tadpole Tales you do not get to know the characters that well in a humanly
            matter, but you do become aware of their abilities and strengths as you clean the river.
            An example of this is with the Frog, you can kill the monsters faster, in return you
            have a much bigger hitbox, making it hard to stay as the powerful frog for a long time.
            What is a Hitbox? A Hitbox is the frames surrounding the character you are using and
            when you have a bigger character, the hitbox of that character is much bigger than one
            that is smaller than the character. This is a big deal In Tadpole Tales because the
            monsters are constantly throwing "garbage" at you and it is hard to dodge these when you
            are a bigger character.</p>

        <p>There are many NPC (Non-Player Character) Characters within the world of Tadpole Tales,
            including the Monsters, Bosses, and the flies that fly over the river and try to polute
            the water. In Tadpole Tales you do not have conversations with these characters it is
            more like you come across them as they are trying to polute the river, while you are
            trying to clean the river. These NPC Characters throw rocks, bombs, and more at you
            while you are cleaning them up.

        <p> The only function within the game is you pick up hearts to gain more health in better

        <p> As a player in the game, I believe it is very hard to get past some levels because you
            don't start with enough health to deal with all the possible things like can hurt you
            within the game. Maybe they should add rounds to the game, so you are ready for the next
            steps instead of just piling them all into one big round.</p>
