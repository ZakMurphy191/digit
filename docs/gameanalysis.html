        <p> For the Game Analysis assignment I had the option of chosing between many indie games to
            provide feedback of my thoughts on the game I chose. This was one of my favorite
            projects that I have completed so far in the Digital Arts and Media major. This Project
            consisted of analyzing the developers concepts and ideas that the developer's have
            created over the course of the game and its making. So what game did I choose?</p>

        <p> Tadpole Tales is an indie game that is solely based on to clean up the river from the
            monsters. I believe that the Monsters represent waste in today's society that is thrown
            into rivers, and the Tadpoles are the creatures that live amongst that biological
            environment that wanna live in a clean envirorment.Within the game the Tadpoles have the
            mission to clean up the river, by shooting them with their mouths using a disinfectant
            that "cleans them up" which gets them closer to living in a clean environment. The Game
            Developers really put a lot of time into this game as it has a real life meaning, and I
            believe that they are trying to spread awareness about our ecosystems. What I mean by
            this is, they want people to understand that our garbage and polution we put into their
            "homes" is damaging to them and the other creatures that live there, while also we
            should be keeping every aspect of the world as clean as possible. </p>

        <p> The graphics of the game are not very complex, but they are unique in their own way
            everything within the game was hand drawn which adds flavor to the game. The game gives
            you the details of the storyline while loading in which added anticipation to help
            defend the river from the monsters that have entered the river, while the tadpoles want
            the river to be clean and friendly, so we must help defend and “clean” up the river. </p>

        <p> The settings in tadpole tails are very easy to control you have three settings start
            extras in options, options allow you to change the graphics within the game start is
            just in the menu which allows you to play the game and extras show you the back story to
            the game and has links to all the creators. In all I would say that the game is very
            easy to maneuver in and is a very pleasant experience.</p>

        <p> Within the game you cannot pick different characters you have to work your way up by
            getting hearts they give you more health which gives you better characters to defeat the
            monsters. I feel that this is something the game developer can improve within as people
            like to make their character into their own. This would give the game a more diverse
            feeling and have users more derived to play the game. </p>
        <p> Within Tadpole Tales you do not get to know the characters that well in a humanly
            matter, but you do become aware of their abilities and strengths as compared to the
            characters before. as you move up in hearts you can get bigger and better characters but
            if you get touched once by any of the monsters you lose a heart and when you have no
            hearts left the game is over.</p>

        <p> The only function within the game is you pick up hearts to gain more health in better
            characters along the way of killing all the monsters in cleaning the river up.</p>

        </div>
        <p> As a player in the game, I believe it is very hard to get past some levels because you
            don't start with enough health to deal with all the possible things like can hurt you
            within the game. Maybe they should add rounds to the game, so you are ready for the next
            steps instead of just piling them all into one big round.</p>
