        <p> For the Game Analysis assignment I had the option of chosing between many indie games to
            provide feedback of my thoughts on the game I chose. This was one of my favorite
            projects that I have completed so far in the Digital Arts and Media major. This Project
            consisted of analyzing the developers concepts and ideas that the developer's have
            created over the course of the game and its making. So what game did I choose?</p>
        <h2 style="text-align:center">Tadpole Tales</h2>
        <h6 style="text-align:center">Developer: Andrei Cretu, Giacomo Autili, Tomer Barnea</h6>
        <p>Tadpole Tales is an indie game that is solely based on to clean up the river from the
            monsters. I believe that the Monsters represent waste in today's society that is thrown
            into rivers, and the Tadpoles are the creatures that live amongst that biological
            environment that wanna live in a clean envirorment.Within the game the Tadpoles have the
            mission to clean up the river, by shooting them with their mouths using a disinfectant
            that "cleans them up" which gets them closer to living in a clean environment. The Game
            Developers really put a lot of time into this game as it has a real life meaning, and I
            believe that they are trying to spread awareness about our ecosystems. What I mean by
            this is, they want people to understand that our garbage and polution we put into their
            "homes" is damaging to them and the other creatures that live there, while also we
            should be keeping every aspect of the world as clean as possible. </p>
