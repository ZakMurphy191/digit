            The most significant challenges for a new learner within github would be understanding how to map out the website. This is because on github we mostly have to be creative and see the "end of the tunnel" by that
            I mean you have to code your website and design it using CSS. Without having a system like Wordpress and it shows you right away the design and layout this was definately the hardest step to get started. On the 
            Other hand, Wordpress is extremely hard to navigate, finding myself lost in the site all the time, i believe wordpress is easier for a beguinner but getting over the hump to understand where and how to edit everything is a very big struggle.
