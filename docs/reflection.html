        <h1>Github And Wordpress Reflection</h1>
    
        <p>
            The most significant challenges for a new learner within github would be understanding how to map out the website. This is because on github we mostly have to be creative and see the "end of the tunnel" by that
            I mean you have to code your website and design it using CSS. Without having a system like Wordpress and it shows you right away the design and layout this was definately the hardest step to get started. On the 
            Other hand, Wordpress is extremely hard to navigate, finding myself lost in the site all the time, i believe wordpress is easier for a beguinner but getting over the hump to understand where and how to edit everything is a very big struggle.     
        </p>
        <p>
            I Think that Github has a bit of an advantage do to the fact that there is more control with what you can do with the pages. 
            From Wordpresses point of view i believe they have a cool feature where you can either type code out or simply type words in and they will do the rest,
            so if you are new i would say that is extremely useful to see how they were able to code the section for you.
        </p>
            <p>
                There are many challenges to Github when it comes down to organizing and laying out the page like, making sure everything is in alighnment, and what CSS code changes specific colors. That is only some of the trouble you can encounter,
                but there are so many going into great detail would be paragraphs long. What i found that helped is being consistant, learning and coding wise, the more you do the more you will understand. Within Wordpress the main challenge
                is figuring out what buttons do what to the page, I would have to give Wordpress the win in this category because they label everything, and you can be a beguinner and somewhat understand the layout and organization. A problem that
                i am having is figuring out how to make the pages go in the order I would like them to go in, for me this is the hardest problem on Wordpress. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The skills that are neccesary to develop or have to be succeful with either websites are, to have a learning drive, learn CSS, and HTML, with these capabilies I believe that you will be succesful
                in the making of a website on Github or Wordpress.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I continue making my website better, I would like to study CSS and HTML more, to create more creative ways to make my website more professional. For instance I would like to create a unique picture as the backround
                of my website, I would also like to add more interactive links, as well as create a more well rounded navigation bar as i struggled to make the navigation bar and it is very generic.
