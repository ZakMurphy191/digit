        <p>Section 1 For the corpus analysis assignment I have decided to compare the similarities
            and differences between two fiction collections by the Bronte sisters and Jane Austen.
            The Bronte sisters promoted there writings to the people as very different from Jane
            Austen’s and in this analysis we will run a test to see if what they were promoting is
            accurate or if they are very similar and it was all a hoax to get you to buy into there
            series. </p>
        <p>The fictional books that we are analyzing are “persuasion” by Jane Austen, and “Wuthering
            heights” by Emily Bronte. We will also be comparing Charlotte Bronte a sister of Emily’s
            that has published “Jane eyre” we will compare this to Jane Austen’s “Wuthering Heights”
            as well to see if that may contain differences or similarities. The main question that I
            am trying to analyze is: Are the Bronte sisters writing's really different from Jane's?
            Specifically Charlotte's.</p>
