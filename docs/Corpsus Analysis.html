        <p>Section 1 For the corpus analysis assignment I have decided to compare the similarities
            and differences between two fiction collections by the Bronte sisters and Jane Austen.
            The Bronte sisters promoted there writings to the people as very different from Jane
            Austen’s and in this analysis we will run a test to see if what they were promoting is
            accurate or if they are very similar and it was all a hoax to get you to buy into there
            series. </p>
        <p>The fictional books that we are analyzing are “persuasion” by Jane Austen, and “Wuthering
            heights” by Emily Bronte. We will also be comparing Charlotte Bronte a sister of Emily’s
            that has published “Jane eyre” we will compare this to Jane Austen’s “Wuthering Heights”
            as well to see if that may contain differences or similarities. The main question that I
            am trying to analyze is: Are the Bronte sisters writing's really different from Jane's?
            Specifically Charlotte's.</p>

            <h5 style="text-align:center"><u>Voyant</u></h5>
            <p>When comparing Jane Austen to Emily Bronte A lot of their most used words are very
                comparable looking through voyant. Jane and Emily use a lot of filler words like “
                having, replied, good, time, said, make, cried, attention opinion, affection,
                replied, and many more. The most notable differences through jeans writing is that
                she she writes in third person and example of this would be she states “ mr., Miss,
                Mrs., Elizabeth, Emma, Catherine.” While Emily’s writing shows a lot of first person
                while she does use Mr., and Mrs. It does not seem to be as important in her writing.
                Her writing seems to be about her self she uses a lot of words like “ I am, I ,
                don’t, tell”. Emily still uses many third person viewpoints in her book but they are
                not as noticeable as in Jane’s. </p>
            <h5 style="text-align:center"><u>Antconc</u></h5>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="column">
                    <img src="antconc2.PNG" alt="Third Person" style="width:50%" class="center">
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <img src="antconc1.PNG" alt="First Person" style="width:50%" class="center">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p> In exploring antconc I have found the same results, Jane has Manny phrases in third
                person while Emily has many phrases in first person. This is interesting because
                this shows that the data I found in voyant is correct. The writing is very different
                from each other in the way that they are telling the story. Jane talks about other
                people in the story of her book such as Elizabeth, Emma, and Catherine, She also
                uses words too show a person like “Mr., and Mrs.” A phrase I found to back this
                information up is “ I am ace very very slow walker, in my face Ridge was high, she
                immediately said:” This shows that even though Jane uses words like I am in her book
                she is still using it in a third person perspective, which proves that they’re
                writing she writes is different from Emily‘s. While Emily talks in first person by
                using the words “I was, I slept, but I,and I have.” Some of the phrases I found to
                back my information up is “ and tell him if he’ll take it, I’ll come and teach him
                to read it” this phrase shows that Emily rights in a third person tale and
                throughout her writing she uses words to describe others In her perspective.</p>
