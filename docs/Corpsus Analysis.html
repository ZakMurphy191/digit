        <p>Section 1 For the corpus analysis assignment I have decided to compare the similarities
            and differences between two fiction collections by the Bronte sisters and Jane Austen.
            The Bronte sisters promoted there writings to the people as very different from Jane
            Austen’s and in this analysis we will run a test to see if what they were promoting is
            accurate or if they are very similar and it was all a hoax to get you to buy into there
            series. </p>
        <p>The fictional books that we are analyzing are “persuasion” by Jane Austen, and “Wuthering
            heights” by Emily Bronte. We will also be comparing Charlotte Bronte a sister of Emily’s
            that has published “Jane eyre” we will compare this to Jane Austen’s “Wuthering Heights”
            as well to see if that may contain differences or similarities. The main question that I
            am trying to analyze is: Are the Bronte sisters writing's really different from Jane's?
            Specifically Charlotte's.</p>

                <u>Voyant</u>
            </h5>
            <p>When comparing Jane Austen to Emily Bronte A lot of their most used words are very
                comparable looking through voyant. Jane and Emily use a lot of filler words like “
                having, replied, good, time, said, make, cried, attention opinion, affection,
                replied, and many more. The most notable differences through jane's writing is that
                she she writes in third person and example of this would be she states “ mr., Miss,
                Mrs., Elizabeth, Emma, Catherine.” While Emily’s writing shows a lot of first person
                while she does use Mr., and Mrs. It does not seem to be as important in her writing.
                Her writing seems to be about her self she uses a lot of words like “ I am, I ,
                don’t, tell”. Emily still uses many third person viewpoints in her book but they are
                not as noticeable as in Jane’s. </p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p> In exploring antconc I have found the same results, Jane has Manny phrases in third
                person while Emily has many phrases in first person. This is interesting because
                this shows that the data I found in voyant is correct. The writing is very different
                from each other in the way that they are telling the story. Jane talks about other
                people in the story of her book such as Elizabeth, Emma, and Catherine, She also
                uses words too show a person like “Mr., and Mrs.” A phrase I found to back this
                information up is “ I am ace very very slow walker, in my face Ridge was high, she
                immediately said:” This shows that even though Jane uses words like I am in her book
                she is still using it in a third person perspective, which proves that they’re
                writing she writes is different from Emily‘s. While Emily talks in first person by
                using the words “I was, I slept, but I,and I have.” Some of the phrases I found to
                back my information up is “ and tell him if he’ll take it, I’ll come and teach him
                to read it” this phrase shows that Emily rights in a third person tale and
                throughout her writing she uses words to describe others In her perspective.</p>

            </div>
            <p> When comparing Jane Austen and Charlotte Bronte in voyant they have quite the
                similarity using words In third person like: she, he , Mr., and names of people such
                as Eliza, John, and Elizabeth. After reviewing Voyage more I noticed that Charlotte
                Bronte is talking in both First and Third person which gives the reader a great
                point of view as they can see both sides to the story. While Jane uses strictly
                third person, this is extremely interesting because Charlotte promoted her book to
                being "completely different from Jane's" Some examples i found using voyant are:
                Charlotte uses lady, she, Mr., Mrs., Miss, Man, come, and felt. While Jane uses some
                of these words as well but uses them in a third person manner within the
                context.</p>

            <p> After thinking about what Voyant has shown me about the two writers I explored and
                dug a little deeper and i found that these writers did not write in the same way and
                I found that Charlotte was not lying when she had said that her "book was completely
                different from janes." Some Example of Charlotte writing in both first and third
                person are: "therefore I was certain i did well. Meantime Mr. Rochester affirmed I
                was wearing him to skin certain of the reality till I had seen Mr. Rochestor again,
                and heard him renew his words and all my features like any other man?" This shows
                that Charlotte is talking in both first person about herself doing well, and Third
                person as she talks about the actions of Mr. Rochester. This i what we call a mixed
                point of view where a writer involves two different point of views within their
                writing. When you look at the Janes writing she states phrases like: "In his present
                behavior to herself, moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the day
                Fanny grew more uncomfortable." In this text you see that she is always talking
                about someone, that is not herself in a third person point of view.</p>
